# Analyzing Semantic Similarities Between ChatGPT and Various Demographics
 This repository was made for saving updates to the analysis script that conducts analysis for my Honors Capstone Project titled: Analyzing Semantic Similarities Between ChatGPT and Various Demographics.

 During the creation of this process I:
  Wrote my first "major" python program
  Programmed a front end for the first time using TKinter (So dont judge it too harshly lol)
  Used an API for the first time (specifically ChatGPT's)
  Used GitHub for the first time to keep track of a project (Its much easier than I expected)

Of note:
  As of current, I do not know how to set up a requirements file, so I will list the packages that need to be installed for this program to work:
   openai==1.61.1
   matplotlib==3.10.1
   numpy==1.26.0
   pillow==11.1.0 (I think this should install with matplotlib)
   scipy==1.15.1
  The responses from ChatGPT that were used for comparison with human responses were generated with a very small script that isnt really worth adding in here. This repository is meant to be a robust methodology that can compare the responses of all types of LLMs (not just ChatGPT), so be sure to create an entry with the responses from the LLM that you want to compare responses with and set the uid of that LLM's response to 0 for the graph data.


In the future I may return to this and make the system more robust and easy to modify.
